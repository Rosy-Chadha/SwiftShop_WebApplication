## Overview
SwiftShop is a product which will revolutionise the industry of retail technology. Swift Shop is an full stack project  which helps you to make shopping experience seemless. Suppose, When a customer in-store is interested in an item, he can scan the respective QR code of the product while having an option of visiting multiple available stores for ticking items off his list without having to carry heavy bags, with just a tap on their smartphone screen. Once scanned from the mobile application, shoppers can confirm their order from the web app and are then redirected to their virtual cart wherein they can make the purchase and have an option to get the items delivered on their doorstep in the most contactless and effortless manner. The user can browse product lists using the filtering and product preview tools, choose the size and add selected products to the cart and wishlist. Next, after sign in/log in he can send an order and view all orders on the list of orders.

## Future Prospects:

1. We will be implementing product mapping system in which user can see the items which are near them.
2. Implemention of AR(Augmented Reality) for marketing using library like AR.js
3. Improving the UI/UX
4. Integration of firebase for real time database.
